Movie Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project conducted as part of preliminary research under the guidance of Dr. Weiwei Sun during the summer. The project employs a Naive Bayes classifier to understand and predict the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. The core mathematics involved in this analysis include the calculation of prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the use of Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that a given movie review expresses a positive sentiment. Our implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm provides a practical application of these concepts to the field of natural language processing and sentiment analysis. The repository includes both the Python code used for the analysis and the datasets of movie reviews that were processed.
